# CS106B_Assignments
The codes for the assignments I have undertaken for the CS106B (Programming Abstractions in C++) course,
in Stanford University. I've provided my own solutions and inputs only, no project files... 
The assignment topics are as follows:

Assignment 1: Pixel manipulation using Grid and Vector data structures.

Assignment 2: Breadth first search, file reading, and random text generation through Markov chains.

Assignment 3: Fractal graphics using recursion (fractals such as Sierpinski, Tree and Mandelbrot Set), grammar structure
solver using recursive exploration.

Assignment 4: Code for the game Boggle(human vs computer), uses recursive backtracking to explore words 
in a boggle game grid.

Assignment 5: Implementation of priority queues using dynamically allocated arrays, binary heaps, and linked lists.

Assignment 6: Implementation of the huffman algorithm using binary trees to build a compression program.

Assignment 7: A* algorithm, Dijkstra, BFS, Alternative path algorithms for path finding in a geographic map that is
represented as a graph.
