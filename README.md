# Stanford_CS106B_Assignments

My solutions to the assignments I have undertaken for the CS106B (Programming Abstractions in C++) course,
in Stanford University. I provided the source codes and input files only, no project files. 

## The assignment topics are as follows:

**Assignment 1**: Pixel manipulation using Grid and Vector data structures.

**Assignment 2**: Breadth first search, file reading, and random text generation through Markov chains.

**Assignment 3**: Fractal graphics using recursion (fractals such as Sierpinski, Tree and Mandelbrot Set), grammar structure
solver using recursive exploration.

**Assignment 4**: Code for the game Boggle(human vs computer), uses recursive backtracking to explore words 
in a boggle game grid.

**Assignment 5**: Implementation of priority queues using dynamically allocated arrays, binary heaps, and linked lists.

**Assignment 6**: Implementation of the huffman algorithm using binary trees to build a compression program.

**Assignment 7**: A* algorithm, Dijkstra, BFS, Alternative path algorithms for path finding in a geographic map that is
represented as a graph.
